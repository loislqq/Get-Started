### Creating an Array
On a computer, Arrays can hold up to N items. The value of N is decided by you, the programmer, at the time you create the Array. This is the same as when we found a big enough cardboard box for the DVDs. 
```
// The actual code for creating an Array to hold DVD's.
DVD[] dvdCollection = new DVD[15];

// A simple definition for a DVD.
public class DVD {
    public String name;
    public int releaseYear;
    public String director;

    public DVD(String name, String releaseYear, String director) {
        this.name = name;
        this.releaseYear = releaseYear;
        this.director = director;
    }

    public String toString() {
        System.out.println(
            this.name + ", directed by " + this.director + ", released in " + this.releaseYear));
    }
}
```

### Accessing Elements in Arrays
The two most primitive Array operations are writing elements into them, and reading elements from them. All other Array operations are built on top of these two primitive operations.

#### Writing Items into an Array
Let's put the DVD for The Avengers into the eighth place of the Array we created above.
```
// Firstly, we need to actually create a DVD object for The Avengers.
DVD avengersDVD = new DVD("The Avengers", 2012, "Joss Whedon");

// Next, we'll put it into the 8th place of the Array. Remember, because we
// started numbering from 0, the index we want is 7.
dvdCollection[7] = avengersDVD;
```
And that's it. We've put the DVD for The Avengers into our Array!

#### Reading Items from an Array
We can check what's at a particular Array index
```
// Print out what's in indexes 7, 10, and 3.
System.out.println(dvdCollection[7]);
System.out.println(dvdCollection[10]);
System.out.println(dvdCollection[3]);

```
#### Writing Items into an Array with a Loop
We commonly use a loop to put lots of values into an Array. To illustrate this, let's go to another example. This time, we're going to create an Array of ints and put the first 10 square numbers into it.

```
int[] squareNumbers = new int[10];

// Go through each of the Array indexes, from 0 to 9.
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // We need to be careful with the 0-indexing. The next square number is given by (i + 1) * (i + 1). Calculate it and insert it into the Array at index i.
    int square = (i + 1) * (i + 1);
    squareNumbers[i] = square;
}

```
#### Reading Items from an Array with a Loop
We can also use a loop to print out everything that's in the Array.

```
// Go through each of the Array indexes, from 0 to 9.
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // Access and print what's at the i'th index.
    System.out.println(squareNumbers[i]);
}

```

There's a more elegant way of printing out the values of an Arrayâ€”a variant of the for loop, commonly referred to as a "for each" loop.

```
// For each VALUE in the Array.
for (int square : squareNumbers) {
    // Print the current value of square.
    System.out.println(square);
}
// Prints exactly the same as the previous example.
```

You'll probably agree that this code is a lot simpler to read. We can use it whenever we don't need the index values. For actually writing the squares into the Array, it wouldn't have worked because we needed to work with the actual index numbers. You don't have to use a "for each" loop when you're starting out, but we recommend you become comfortable with it before interviews. Simple, elegant code is good code!

### Array Capacity VS Length
If somebody asks you how long the DVD Array is, what what would your answer be?

There are two different answers you might have given.

1. The number of DVDs the box could hold, if it was full, or
1. The number of DVDs currently in the box.

Both answers are correct, and both have very different meanings! It's important to understand the difference between them, and use them correctly. We call the first one the capacity of the Array, and the second one the length of the Array.

#### Array Capacity

Let's say we've created a new Array like this.

```
DVD[] array = new DVD[6]
```
Is it a valid operation to insert an element at array[6]? What about at array[10]?

Nope, neither of these are valid. When we created the Array, we specified that it can hold up to 6 DVD's. This is the Array's capacity.

Remembering that indexing starts at 0, we can only insert items at array[0], array[1], array[2], array[3], array[4], and array[5]. Trying to put an element anywhere else, such as array[-3], array[6], or array[100] will cause your code to crash with an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException!

The Array's capacity must be decided when the Array is created. The capacity cannot be changed later. 

So, what do we do if we get a 7th DVD and we'd like all our DVD's in the same Array? Well, unfortunately it's the same as it is with our cardboard box. We'll need to go get a larger one, and then move all the existing DVD's into it, along with the new one.

The capacity of an Array in Java can be checked by looking at the value of its length attribute. This is done using the code arr.length, where arr is the name of the Array. Different programming languages have different ways of checking the length of an Array.
```
int capacity = array.length;
System.out.println("The Array has a capacity of " + capacity);
Running this code will give the following output:
```
C#, int capacity = array.Length;

The Array has a capacity of 6
Yup, it's a bit confusing that you need to access the capacity of an Array by using .length. Unfortunately, this is just something you'll need to get used to.


#### Array Length
```
// Create a new array with a capacity of 6.
int[] array = new int[6];

// Current length is 0, because it has 0 elements.
int length = 0;

// Add 3 items into it.
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    array[i] = i * i;
    // Each time we add an element, the length goes up by one.
    length++;
}

System.out.println("The Array has a capacity of " + array.length);
System.out.println("The Array has a length of " + length);
```

## Python numbers

There are two main number types:
1. Integers which are whole numbers.
2. Floating point numbers which are numbers with a decimal

***Python uses Dynamic typing, this means we can reassign variables to different data types.***

this is OK in Python
```
my_dogs = 2
my_dogs = ["Sammy", "Franky"]
```

## Strings

Strings are sequences of characters, using the syntax of either single quotes or double quotes
1. 'hello'
2. "Hello"
3. "I don't do that"

Because strings are ordered sequences, it means we can use indexing and slicing to grab sub-sections of the string.

```
mystring = "Hello World"
mystring[2]
mystring[-3]

mystring[2:]  # 'llo World'
mystring[:3]  # 'Hel'
mystring[1:4] # 'ell'
mystring[::2] # 'HloWrd'
```
